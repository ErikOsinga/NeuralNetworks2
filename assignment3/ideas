The idea is to convert satellite images to street maps.

We should probably start pretty zoomed in, and we can try to see how far we can push it later.

Main thing is that we need a way to download the google maps X and Y images


Maybe download this

Somehow this is useful

http://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?sensor=false&size=512x512&center=Leiden&zoom=12&style=feature:all|element:labels|visibility:off

And this too

https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/map-coordinates

Ok so we can get the satellite images
